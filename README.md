# About me

- I can do some coding, guess that makes me smart
- I can boot up Kali and ParrotOS, I guess that I'm a hacker now (ParrotOS>Kali)
  - Just wait till I have a degree in cybersecurity. 
- Open Source is the way
- Slight Red Hat fan girl

### More stuff about me, like the stuff that you might actually want to know

- Pronouns: They/Them
- Deadname for those who still don't know: Bridger
- Contact: Email me, the link should be on the side of the page. Also, shameless plug for Tutanota. *(Their not paying me, I'm just a fan)*

# Working on / Learning 

- Learning BASH scripting
- learning Python
- Thinking about learning Rust. Don't ask why I haven't learned it yet, I'm just a little bit lazy
- Administering my power hungery home lab, which is currently running RHEL

# Website

- Really? Honestly I'm shocked that you think I know HTML and Javascript well enough to build a website. I do have a site, munkycool.com, but I still don't know much coding. Might be a problem in the future, but I've heard good things about ChatGPT.

# Thanks for looking at the best page on GitHub
