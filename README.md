# About me

- I can do some coding, guess that makes me smart
- I can boot up Kali and ParrotOS, I guess that I'm a hacker now (ParrotOS>Kali)
- Open Source is the way

### More stuff about me, like the stuff that you might actually want to know

- Pronouns: They/Them
- Contact: Email me, the link should be on the side of the page. Also, shameless plug for Tutanota. *(Their not paying me, I'm just a fan)*

# Working on / Learning 

- Learning BASH scripting
- Thinking about learning Python
- Thinking about learning Rust. Don't ask why I haven't learned it yet, I'm just a little bit lazy

# Website

- Really? Honestly I'm shocked that you think I know HTML and Javascript well enough to build a website

# Thanks for looking at the best page on GitHub
