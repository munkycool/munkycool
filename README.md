# About me

- Double majoring in cybersecurity engineering and polital science
    - I'm interested in the intersection of technology and politics. Esspecially regarding the queer community, of which I am a part of üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
- I can do some coding, guess that makes me smart
- I can boot up Kali and ParrotOS, I guess that I'm a hacker now (ParrotOS>Kali)
  - Just wait till I have a degree in cybersecurity. 
- Open Source is the way
- I'm in love... in love with Linux üêß
- Slight Red Hat fan girl
    - \*slightly tips fedora* m'lady 
 - Apple fan girl 
    - Apple silicon is just too good, can you blame me?

### More stuff about me, like the stuff that you might actually want to know

- Pronouns: She/They
- Deadname for those who still don't know: Bridger
- Contact: Email me, the link should be on the side of the page. Also, shameless plug for Tutanota. *(They're not paying me, I'm just a fan)*

# Working on / Learning 

- Studying cybersecurity engineering and political science at the wonderful Iowa State University
- Learning BASH scripting
- learning Python (PS I love snakes)
- Learning Java even though I can already brew a mean cup of coffee
- Thinking about learning Rust. Don't ask why I haven't learned it yet, I'm just a little bit lazy
- Administering my power hungry home lab, which is currently running RHEL

# What I actually know 

- I know the basics of R üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
- I embodied the old cat lady that I am at heart, and learned the basics of C
- I'm pretty good at Linux, if I do say so myself

# Website

- Really? Honestly I'm shocked (and a bit flattered) that you think I know HTML, CSS, and Javascript well enough to build a website. I do have a site, art3mix.com, but I still don't know much coding. Might be a problem in the future, but I've heard good things about ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot.

# Thanks for looking at the best page on GitHub
